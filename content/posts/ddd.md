# My experience with Documentation Driven Design

Before major construction projects start building, the entire project is planned out. 
Timelines are laid out, milestones are set, and _blueprints_ are created. 
When the construction crew comes to start work, everything they need to know should be specified in the blueprints.

Software projects are often planned in a similar way, but the developer is rarely handed blueprints that lay out the work to be done in detail.
There may be mockups, specifications, user stories, but rarely are we given anything with the level of detail that blueprints provide.

This is totally fair, the engineers are responsible for making the blueprints, and as many developers like to compare themselves to engineers, we are the ones 
that should be responsible for making the blueprints. I'm here to tell you why you should make your own blueprints.
