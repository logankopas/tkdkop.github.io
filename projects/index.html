I am developing using javascript, phonegap, and phaser game engine. 
I began developing this as a side project to practice using javascript and to get something

The game can be played with either mouse or touchscreen, however it is designed

This is an application developed at <a href="http://hackdays.ca/category/hackregina/" target = "_blank" > hackRegina. </a>
Myself and 2 others had 8 hours to 
build some sort of software using any of the sponsors' APIs. We developed a C# application
using both the GasBuddy and Google Maps APIs. You give this application your journey start 
and destination and it returns to you a list of the cheapest gas stations along your journey.
This was the first time any of our group members had developed anything using http requests, APIs,
or even JSON. We placed 3rd and won $250.

<h2>PostgreSQL Database // CMPT 355 // Theory and Application of Databases</h2>
<p>
This is the largest project I have been a part of, and the one I am most proud of. 
The goal of this project was to make a database system for a museum.
The project was assigned in two stages. The first was done by each student individually.
First we had to scrape information pertaining to 100 museum items from a real-world museum's website.
Then we set up our database to store all of these items, as well as information on 
museum galleries and exhibits. There were 3 assignments that each required extensions to the
database such as adding support for borrowed items, travelling exhibitions, and multi-gallery 
exhibits. In the second stage we were put into groups of 5 and told that our museums were merging
and that the new owner wanted to have one database system to support the needs of all 5 museums.
After setting up our new database, merging our previous databases, and setting up various triggers and 
automation, we were left with a robust, automated, database, 35 000 lines of SQL, and an exceptional mark
on the project. You can see the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dfwtj0ckh5t33ko/CMPT355-FinalProjectReport.docx?dl=0">

For this project we explored an alternative to the standard group chat interface. 
Most group chats follow the same linear conversation layout as the standard 2-person chat. 
Often times this layout can cause ambiguity as shown in the first part of the video. We decided that there
was a better way to capture the feeling of a small-group conversation in a chat interface. As
you can see in the second part we decided to throw out the linear layout and go with a circular layout.
We also added the ability to send direct replies to certain messages. After user testing we found that 
this interface was easier to use and removed ambiguities from online group conversations.

<h2>Patient Life Simulator // CMPT 371 // Software Management</h2>
<p>
The focus of this class was to simulate a large-scale software project similar to what you
would find in industry. There were approximately 10 people to a group, and we were divided 
into teams such as dev, testing, and triage. I took on the role of testing lead. The project started with
a number of clients coming in and pitching project ideas to us. After we selected a project to pursue 
we had to gather requirements from the client, present incremental deliverables to the client and the 
class, review requirements, develop, and test the system. As testing lead I became familiar with
using Jasmine for a mocking framework, using instanbul.js for code coverage reporting, and........

<h2>Test Driven Development Report // CMPT 470 // Software Engineering II</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W34u2n9FYCxn_SjqOwwOS6VKwM_xcLOKMt93YHQ9cOA/edit?usp=sharing">This</a> is a report I did on the Test Driven Development software engineering practice. 
TDD is a development cycle in which tests are written before code is written. 
Tests are written that initially fail, then the code is written that makes the tests pass.
I, personally, fully support TDD design. It is practical for any scale of system and can be done 
both individually and as a group. Even as part of a large team with designated testers, developers
write their own unit tests and use TDD to ensure they are passing quality code to the test team,
who can then perform system and integration testing. I apologize for the poor formatting of the 
report, this report was written before I was familiar with LaTeX.
