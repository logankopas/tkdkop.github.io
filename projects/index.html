I am developing using javascript, phonegap, and phaser game engine.

The game can be played with either mouse or touchscreen, however it is designed
to be played in landscape mode when viewed on a mobile device.

This is an application developed at <a href="http://hackdays.ca/category/hackregina/" target = "_blank" > hackRegina. </a>
Myself and 2 others had 8 hours to 
build some sort of software using any of the sponsors' APIs. We developed a C# application
using both the GasBuddy and Google Maps APIs. You give this application your journey start 
and destination and it returns to you a list of the cheapest gas stations along your journey.
This was the first time any of our group members had developed anything using http requests, APIs,
or even JSON. We placed 3rd and won $250.

<h2>Bioinformatic Software Engineering // CMPT 405 // Project Design and Implementation</h2>
<p>
As part of the Software Engineering program I am required to undertake a 
software engineering project under one of the computer science faculty members.
I decided to work under one of the bioinformatics professors and am extending
the PIIKA2 software used by many bioinformatics researchers for analyzing kinome
microarray data. I am currently in the early stages of development but I will
be working mainly with R and the main focus is to improve the data visualization
offered by the software. 
</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL Database // CMPT 355 // Theory and Application of Databases</h2>
<p>
This is the largest project I have been a part of, and the one I am most proud of. 
The goal of this project was to make a database system for a museum.
The project was assigned in two stages. The first was done by each student individually.
First we had to scrape information pertaining to 100 museum items from a real-world museum's website.
Then we set up our database to store all of these items, as well as information on 
museum galleries and exhibits. There were 3 assignments that each required extensions to the
database such as adding support for borrowed items, travelling exhibitions, and multi-gallery 
exhibits. In the second stage we were put into groups of 5 and told that our museums were merging
and that the new owner wanted to have one database system to support the needs of all 5 museums.
After setting up our new database, merging our previous databases, and setting up various triggers and 
automation, we were left with a robust, automated database, 35 000 lines of SQL, and an exceptional mark
on the project. You can see the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dfwtj0ckh5t33ko/CMPT355-FinalProjectReport.docx?dl=0">

<p>
For this project we explored an alternative to the standard group chat interface. 
The above video is a demonstration of the following problem with common chat 
systems, and our medium fidelity prototype meant to deal with said problem.
Most group chats follow the same linear conversation layout as the standard 2-person chat. 
Often times this layout can cause ambiguity as shown in the first part of the video. We decided that there
was a better way to capture the feeling of a small-group conversation in a chat interface. As
you can see in the second part we decided to throw out the linear layout and go with a circular layout.
We also added the ability to send direct replies to certain messages. After user testing we found that 
this interface was easier to use and removed ambiguities from online group conversations.

<h2>Patient Life Simulator // CMPT 371 // Software Management</h2>
<p>
The focus of this class was to simulate a large-scale software project similar to what you
would find in industry. There were approximately 10 people to a group, and we were divided 
into teams such as dev, testing, and triage. I took on the role of testing lead. The project started with
a number of clients coming in and pitching project ideas to us. After we selected a project to pursue 
we had to gather requirements from the client, present incremental deliverables to the client and the 
class, review requirements, develop, and test the system.
We used phonegap, jQuery, ajax, jasmine, and other technologies, but the most 
valuable experience we gained was that of following industry style development
practices. We had automated build and testing, daily commits, weekly meetings,
issue tracking, and client deliverables.

<h2>Naiive Bayes Classifier // CMPT 317 // Intro Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>
<a href="/portfolio/asn2.tar">This</a> 
is an NBC created for an AI assignment. I have packaged the entire 
assignment into a <a href="/portfolio/asn2.tar">tar file.</a>
It contains a readme file with instructions on running the program, some sample
data files, and A3.pdf, which is the assignment description. 
</p>
<h2>KNN Classifiers // CMPT 487 // Computer Vision and Image Processing</h2>
<p>
This assignment focused on K Nearest Neighbour classification. The first part
was to classify images of leaves into their appropriate groups based on 
their Histogram of Curvature Scale (HoCS). The second part was to classify textures
based on their Gray-Level Co-Occurence Matrix (GLCM) and their rotationally-invariant 
Local Binary Patterns (LBP-VAR). This was my first application of machine
learning.

<h2>Test Driven Development Report // CMPT 470 // Software Engineering II</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W34u2n9FYCxn_SjqOwwOS6VKwM_xcLOKMt93YHQ9cOA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">
This</a> is a report I did on the Test Driven Development software engineering practice. 
TDD is a development cycle in which tests are written before code is written. 
Tests are written that initially fail, then the code is written that makes the tests pass.
I, personally, fully support TDD design. It is practical for any scale of system and can be done 
both individually and as a group. Even as part of a large team with designated testers, developers
write their own unit tests and use TDD to ensure they are passing quality code to the test team,
who can then perform system and integration testing. I apologize for the poor formatting of the 
report, this report was written before I was familiar with LaTeX.
