# Staying Safe When Traveling to the USA

_It's dystopic to reminisce about the days when gun violence was the only thing to worry about when traveling to the USA._

If you've been following the news, you've probably heard that [at least 10 countries](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/which-countries-have-issued-travel-advisories-for-the-us) have issued travel advisories for the United States, tourists have been questioned and [detained](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/12/ice-tourist-detention-border-trump-immigration/82740260007/) within the states, and even American citizens [are being detained at border crossings](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/lawyer-detained-canada-border-bachir-atallah-b2733665.html).
While it's not clear what could cause a person to be questioned at the border, it is clear that they [can](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/03/21/border-control-phone-search/82594653007/) and [will](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/trump-musk-french-scientist-detained) go through your phone or devices to find whatever it is they're looking for.

If you're planning to travel to the United States, my advice would be: _don't_. If you must, make sure you check your government's travel advisories, have someone checking in on you regularly from home, register with your consulate, and make sure you keep your devices secure.

## Device Security: Leave it at home

The best way to make sure your device is safe, secure, and out of the prying eyes of border control is to leave it at home.
