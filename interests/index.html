<p>
As you can probably guess from my major, I enjoy programming. I really enjoy
algorithms and compete in different programming competitions including
google code jam and the ACM ICPC programming competitions.<br><br>
The classes I have taken on AI and computer vision have been very interesting,
and I would like to learn more in those areas of computer science.<br><br>
I also enjoy learning new programming languages and have fooled around
with a bunch of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">esoteric programming languages</a>. <br>A few examples:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/assets/calc.bf" target="_blank">a calculator written in befunge</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/assets/logan.bf" target="_blank">a secret message written in brainfuck</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/assets/primez.lc" target="_blank">a prime number generator written in lolcode</a><br><br>
I am also very interested in security testing. I have fooled around a bit 
with Damn Vulnerable Web App, and am currently trying to pass the final level
of the Natas web game by <a href="http://www.overthewire.org" target="_blank">
overthewire.org</a>. Both of these have taught me a lot about developing secure
websites and applications.<br>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:right;">Volunteer</h2>
<p>
I really enjoy doing volunteer work. The feeling of camaraderie that you get
when you spend your free time working together with a group of people, 
coupled with the sense of accomplishment you experience when 
do something selfless is exquisite.<br>
<br>Currently I am spending my free time organizing and leading youth group at
my church in my hometown while attending school. I am also a member of the 
Computer Science Students' Society at the University; I organize
intramural sports teams and other social events for Computer Science Students.<br>
<br> This past summer I spent a couple weeks volunteering at Circle Square
Ranch Bible Camp taking care of and training horses, and giving kids riding 
lessons.<br>
<br>Some of my previous volunteer experience includes being a member of 
<a href="http://www.4h.ab.ca/About/index.html" target="_blank">4H</a> for many years, and travelling to Mexico on two missions trips that
included building houses and running a daily bible school.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:right;">Personal</h2>
<p>
I am very passionate about sports. When I was very young I played hockey, 
but when I became a teenager I switched to taekwondo and and played on my
school's soccer and basketball teams. I continued my involvement with hockey as
a referee and began reffing soccer as well. <br><br>
Just before I turned 17 I got my blackbelt in taekwondo. After I accomplished 
this major goal of mine, my involvement with martial arts dwindled and recently
I have turned my focus to weightlifting noncompetitively.<br><br>
I have also become very involved with intramural sports while in university,
and for the last couple years I have been on 4 different teams each semester.
<br> <br>
I played guitar a lot when I was younger. In fact, I was part of a rock band
in high school that I received school credit for. We put on a concert at the 
end of each school year as a sort of final exam. I have not found much time
to pursue my musical interests while in university, but would like to get back
into it eventually.<br><br>

I also dabble a bit in graffiti. I honed my skills by painting two walls in my 
parent's basement and I also have a work on display at my hometown church.
I have not touched a lot of graffiti lately, but I did teach a couple art 
classes at my old high school recently.
<br><br>
Lastly, growing up on a cattle ranch I spent a lot of my childhood on horseback.
I love horses and find a lot of similarities between training horses 
and programming computers. As a living being horses are a lot more complex
and unpredictable than a computer (in some ways) but teaching a horse is not
unlike teaching a computer. It just requires the proper language.
