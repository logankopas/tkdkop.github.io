# The Personal Journal of Logan Kopas

This is my knowledge garden.  I hope to fill this space with thoughts, ideas, and things that I've learned. 
My hope is that, through the act of writing, sharing, and conversing, these ideas can grow and this garden will flourish.

Thank you for being a part of this.
